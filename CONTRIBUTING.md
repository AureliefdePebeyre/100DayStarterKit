# Connect  

### How can you help?  


**Join our translation sprint!**
For this sprint, we're working on translating a 100-day starter kit from English to French to help connect people and families with autism to important services and information. For information on our entire project, please visit our README (https://github.com/ConnectProject/100DayStarterKit/blob/master/README.md).


**Join our efforts on GitHub!**
 Everybody is very welcome! For this particular sprint, people who speak French is necessary. Have you been coding all day and want a break that still helps people? Translating a couple pages will make great progress in connecting people with services they need!


**Get in touch with us!**
We don't need just translators. Graphic designers, coders, interactive/UX designers, educators, and clinicians are all welcome to contribute. We'd love to hear from you! You can also e-mail us to get in touch at aaron.engelberg at gmail dot com!


**We are looking forward to meeting you!**
