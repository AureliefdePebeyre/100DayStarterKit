# How to Start Working on an Issue - Thank you !!
###### Instructions:
1) Each page not completed has an issue associated with it. Once you start working on a translation, comment on the issue in which you're working.
2) Of course, use the issue space to ask any questions or comments. No need to comment everything you changed.
3) After reviewing the translation and making the appropriate changes, comment again that the translation is finished being reviewed.

## Thank you for your contributions!
